# knights-travails

- This project implements a solution to the Knight’s Travails problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS) in JavaScript.

- A knight on a standard 8x8 chessboard can move in an “L” shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular. Given a starting square and a target square, the goal is to find all shortest possible paths the knight can take to reach its destination.
